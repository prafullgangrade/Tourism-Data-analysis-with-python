# Tourism-Data-analysis-with-python

**Goal**

The main objective of this project is to analyze the tourism data of Telangana, a state in India, and to identify the trends and patterns in the data using Python. The data set used in this project is obtained from the Telangana Tourism website, which contains information about the number of tourists visiting different tourist destinations in the state.

The following tools and technologies can be used for this project:

- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis

- NumPy for scientific computing

- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for data visualization


The project involves the following steps:


**Data Collection**: The first step is to collect the data from the Telangana Tourism website. The data can be downloaded in the form of an Excel file or a CSV file.

**Data Preprocessing**: The data obtained from the website may contain missing values, duplicates, or outliers. Hence, it is essential to preprocess the data to remove these inconsistencies.

**Data Analysis**: After preprocessing, the data is ready for analysis. The project involves analyzing the data to identify the trends and patterns in the number of tourists visiting different tourist destinations in Telangana over the past 10 years.

**Data Visualization**: The analysis results are visualized using various charts and graphs. Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly can be used to create interactive visualizations.
